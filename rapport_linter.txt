2024-01-19 15:20:52 HIGH: Specify at least 1 USER command in Dockerfile with non-root user as argument
2024-01-19 15:20:52 ════════════════════════════════════════
2024-01-19 15:20:52 Running containers with 'root' user can lead to a container escape situation. It is a best practice to run containers as non-root users, which can be done by adding a 'USER' statement to the Dockerfile.

2024-01-19 15:22:48 ════════════════════════════════════════
2024-01-19 15:22:48 Running containers with 'root' user can lead to a container escape situation. It is a best practice to run containers as non-root users, which can be done by adding a 'USER' statement to the Dockerfile.
